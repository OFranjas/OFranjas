# Hey, I'm Gonçalo Ferreira! 👋

## About Me
🎓 **I'm a Master's student in Software Engineering** at Universidade de Coimbra, deeply engrossed in refining my craft. With a backbone in Computer Science, my academic journey is a quest for innovation and excellence in the software realm.

🌐 While my heart beats for all things software, I'm drawn to the art and science of Web Development, aspiring to master **Full Stack Development**. It's not just about coding for me—it's about building bridges between ideas and reality.

## Interests
🏀 Off the keyboard, I'm either shooting hoops or cheering on my favorite football team. ⚽️

🕹️ And when it's time to unwind, you'll find me lost in the world of video games or planning the next great adventure with friends. 🌍
